"""Disposable teleports

The island has eight stations which are connected by a network of
teleports; however, the teleports take a very long time to
recharge. This means you can only use each one once. After you use a
teleport, it will shut down and no longer function. But you can visit
any station more than once. For this task, you should begin at number 1
and try to travel around to all the stations before returning to the
starting point. The map of the teleports is presented as a string in
which the comma-separated list represents teleports. Each teleport is
given the name of the station it connects to. This name consists of two
digits, such as '12' or '32.' Each test requires you to provide a route
which passes through every station. A route is presented as a string of
the station numbers in the sequence in which they must be visited
(ex. 123456781).

Input: A teleport map as a string.

Output: The sequence of station numbers as a string.

How it is used: This task is another example of the graph-search
problem. Itâ€™s like trying to find a route where you can not to step on
the same spot twice.

Precondition:
len(stations) == 8
Teleports are not repeated and undirected.
