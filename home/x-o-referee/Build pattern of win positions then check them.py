"""Xs and Os Referee

Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two
players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The
player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this
games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine
if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the
winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the
O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are
players' marks and "." is the empty cell.

Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).

Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.

How it is used: The concepts in this task will help you when iterating
data types. They can also be used in game algorithms, allowing you to
know how to check results.

Precondition:
There is either one winner or a draw.
len(game_result) == 3
all(len(row) == 3 for row in game_result)
